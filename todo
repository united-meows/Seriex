make spawn work for minigame spawns, not seriex spawn. (suggestion by V3NOM)

maybe make a toml config file for CONSTANTS texts like KICK MESSAGES, VERIFY MESSAGES
and add Language support (only for server messages)

/party system ???????????????????? # for what?

c17 seriex api? # no
and seriex website api # maybe
